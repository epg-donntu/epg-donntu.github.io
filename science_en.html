    <h2>Scientific research</h2>
<p>Annually losses around the world from accidents and accidents at the
industrial enterprises average 150 billion dollars.</p>
<div class="rimg">

<p>Safety of the industrial enterprise at its operation — it achievements
of normalized level vzryvo-and fire safety on it, i.e. an exception of
explosions (fires) due to reliable work of means of protection which
react to inadmissible change of electric and technological parameters of
the equipment, accurate work of the service personnel.</p>
<p>The industrial enterprise (fire and explosion hazardous shop) is
considered safe if it is possible to prove that the probability of
emergence of accident within a year, at its operation will be less or is
equal to size 1.10-6.</p>
<div class="limg">
<p><img src="images/science/2.jpg" alt="" /></p>
</div>
<p>Using norm 1.10-6 task of safety of the industrial enterprise it is
possible to formulate as follows: what statistical information from
technological object needs to be collected within a year to define level
of its safety (explosion safety, fire safety) and if it appears more
normalized size 1.10-6, what organizational and technical actions it is
necessary to use at operation of this enterprise (the nuclear power
plant, mines, gas pipelines, sea vessels, a warehouse of ammunition
etc.) almost completely to exclude accidents on it.</p>
<p>Accident which happens at the industrial enterprise — this difficult
event. Practically any accident can be presented as coincidence process
in space and time: equipment failures; means of protection; mistakes of
the person.</p>

</div>
<p>On EPG chair on the basis of Markov casual processes with discrete
number of states and continuous time mathematical models which describe
process of formation of accidents are developed. At the industrial
enterprise dangerous concerning explosions and fires.</p>
<p>By means of the received mathematical models and applied programs it is
possible to receive the main characteristics of safety of the studied
enterprise (shop). To reveal the most dangerous concerning explosions
and fires of the enterprise and to offer concrete organizational
technical actions with the minimum economic expenses at which this
enterprise becomes safe — it means that the probability of emergence of
explosions and fires within a year at this enterprise will be size
improbable.</p>
<p>In the direction of an assessment of safety of technological objects the
chair published over 50 scientific articles.</p>
<p>Results of use of the research works, the “Power Supply of Industrial
Companies and Cities” executed on chair:</p>

fields of northern regions of the Tyumen region (DPI, by the State
academy of oil and gas of I.M. Gubkin is developed, ON
“Yamburggazdobycha” in 1993), 20 p.</li>
<li>Technique of an assessment of probability of emergence of fire and
explosion situations in systems of power supply of gas fields, on
technological installations and rooms in which they are exploited
(it is developed by the State academy of oil and gas of I.M. Gubkin,
Donetsk state technical university and RJSC “Gazprom” in 1995), 33
p.</li>
<li>Technique of an assessment of explosion safety of deadlock

<li>Technique of an assessment of level of safety of systems of power

</ol>
<p>More than 90% of fires in electric networks of inhabited apartments
occur at casual emergence of weakened and dangerously scintillating
contact connection in a power electric network that leads to
inadmissible overheats of power contact connection, and it in turn leads
to ignition of isolation of conductors or ignition of combustible
materials which are near dangerously heated power contact connection
(wall-paper, carpets, wooden overlappings, false ceilings, etc.).</p>
<p>Protective switching devices now in use don't react to similar emergency
operation.</p>
<p>The prototype of protection which allows to reveal weakened and
dangerously scintillating power contact connections is developed and
constructed. Protection is based on allocation of high-frequency
fluctuations of current of the industrial frequency of 50 Hz with their
further processing and giving on executive bodies of the industrial
device of protective shutdown (DPS).</p>
<p>When using the offered device of protection at the same time with UZO in
electric networks of inhabited apartments reduction of fires for 90% is
predicted. Across Donetsk region the number of fires will be reduced by
4211 cases, and expected economic effect of reduction of fires makes
45587 yew. UAH a year.</p>
<p>On a subject of research four patents are taken out and a number of
articles is published.</p>
<p>Annually chair organizes <a href="http://etf.donntu.ru/konf_epm/">conference on questions modern power
supply</a>. On a conference і ї carry out

</div>
<p>Since 2003 on chair research work within state subject on research of
possibility of clearing of a flame by electric field is conducted.</p>
<p>Relevance of a subject is defined by complexity of modern fire
protection systems, need of use for them metal-consuming and demanding
periodic replacement of the extinguishing means.</p>
<div class="rimg">
<p><img src="images/science/fire_3.jpg" alt="" /></p>
</div>
<p>The experimental installation consisting of the power unit (the raising
transformer, the rectifying high-voltage bridge, protection system), the
control panel with possibility of giving on electrodes high (to 75 kV
with a frequency of 50 Hz) tension was developed. The torch is a source
of a flame.</p>
