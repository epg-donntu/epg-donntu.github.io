    <h2>For the entrant</h2>
<p>The “Power Supply of Industrial Companies and Cities” (EPG) chair was
created on October 14, 1968. For last years more than 3000 electrical
engineers, including about 300 people for foreign countries are trained.</p>
<p>The direction of preparation 050701 — “Electrical equipment and
electrotechnologies”</p>
<p>The chair is letting out in “Electrotechnical systems of a power
consumption” on all levels of preparation: bachelor (6.050701), expert
(7.05070103), master (8.05070103). In 2000 within specialty the
following specializations are open:: “Electrotechnical systems of power
supply of industrial companies”, “Electrotechnical systems of power
supply of the cities”.</p>
<p>Educational process is carried out in a two-staged form.</p>
<ul>
<li>Training at the <span class="bld">first step</span> is made during 8
semester and comes to the end with state examination or the thesis.
Upon termination of training at the first step the bachelor's degree
is issued and qualification the bachelor-electrician is appropriated.
With the bachelor's degree the graduate can begin work or continue
training for obtaining qualification the expert. From among students
excellent students candidates for education continuation according to
the program the “master-electrician” get out.</li>
<li>Training at the <span class="bld">second step</span> lasts 2 or 3
semester and comes to the end with protection of the thesis (project)
or a master's thesis respectively.</li>
</ul>
<p>Preparation in the specialty is carried out on day and correspondence
forms of education. The best students have opportunity to be trained on
military chair after which termination the officer rank is appropriated.
The group is formed of students of specialty “Electrotechnical systems
of power supply” for training at the French technical faculty with
profound studying of French with possibility of passing of the included
education in France.</p>
<p>The main field of activity of graduates of specialty is transfer,
distribution and electricity consumption, and objects of their activity
— systems of power supply of the enterprises, the cities, agriculture.
They can be engaged in design, operational, organizational and
administrative activity, and also research and teaching work in the
manufacturing, operational and electroassembly enterprises, in design
and research institutes, the enterprises of agro-industrial complex.</p>
<p>Graduates of specialty “Electrotechnical systems of power supply” can
work at positions: the operation and electric equipment repair engineer
— in departments of the chief power engineer, the repairman of electric
equipment of producing departments of the enterprises, the electrician
of shop, the engineer of specialized electrotechnical laboratory on
industrial production; the engineer and the research engineer in design
and research institutes; engineer, laboratory manager, the assistant,
the teacher in educational institutions; the foreman, masters in
installations of industrial wiring; power of the enterprises of an
agrarian and industrial complex. They can carry out duties of the
administrative personnel: chief power engineer (electrician) of the
enterprise; chief, deputy chief, shift supervisor, senior master, job
foremaster of an electrorepair shop; foreman (site) of networks and
substations; the chief of electroshop of combined heat and power plant,
the chief of electrotechnical laboratory, and also can be the reviewer
or the manager in business concerns and advertizing agencies which are
connected with power supply and a power consumption, etc.</p>
<p>About a high skill level of teachers says that fact that more than 80%
of structure of chair have scientific degrees and ranks. Now the chair
has a modern display class, the subject audience, six educational
laboratories. Existence of good material base, modern computer aids and
highly skilled teachers allows chair to prepare engineering shots of
high qualification.</p>
