    <h2>Chair history</h2>
<p>The first release of electrical engineers in “Power supply of the
industrial enterprises, the cities and agriculture” in number of 15
people is carried out in 1966 within chair “Power plants, networks and
systems”. On October 14, 1968 the “Power Supply of the Industrial
Enterprises and Cities”, chair which first manager there was
Cand.Tech.Sci., PhD Kurenny E.G was created. Cand.Tech.Sci., associate
professors stood at the origins of basis of chair Zhelikhovsky N.M.,
Stepanchuk D.N., senior teachers Pogodin M.K., Sorokin F.A., assistants
Dmitriyeva E.N. Mucha W.P., Nikiforov P.R., Sanayev A.M., Yarmolenko
V.I., lab. manager. Pozhidayev A.A. During the different periods of time
chair directed Dr.Sci.Tech., prof. Kurenny E.G. (1968–1975 and
1981–1985), Dr.Sci.Tech., prof. Razgildeev G. I. (1979–1981),
Cand.Tech.Sci., PhD. Sovpel V. B. (1975–1979 and 1986–1995). Since
April, 1995 chair Cand.Tech.Sci., the prof. of chair Mucha W.P. manages.
Gradually the structure of teachers replenished with a number of highly
qualified specialists. Fruitfully work from 70th years Cand.Tech.Sci.,
PhD. Oleynik V. G. and Kolomyttsev A.D., since the 80th years -
Cand.Tech.Sci., PhD. Chursinov V.I., Dzhura S.G., Vasin A.A.,
Dr.Sci.Tech., prof. Kovalyov A.P., assistant Halyavinskaya N. M.,
Brezhneva V. V. In the 90th years the young specialists who have
defended master's dissertations came to chair: Pogrebnyak N.N., Shlepnev
S.V., Bershadsky I.A., Spivakovsky A.V.</p>
<p>Efforts of teachers, laboratory assistants and students created
laboratories on the main disciplines. Now the chair has a modern display
class, the subject audience, five educational laboratories: electric
lighting, electric devices and automation equipment, power supply,
electrotechnological installations, electrotechnical materials.</p>
<p>Existence of good material base, modern computer aids and highly skilled
teachers (75% of teachers with scientific degrees) allows chair to
prepare engineering shots of high qualification. Teachers of chair read
18 subject matters among which along with the traditional and
fundamental courses “Power Supply of the Industrial Enterprises”,
“Electrotechnical Materials”, “Electrotechnological Plants”, “Electric
Devices”, “Power Supply of the Cities” etc. are entered new, answering
to rapid development of computer facilities and high technologies: “W
and software”, “Mathematical problems of power”, “Theory of automatic
control”, “Microprocessor equipment”, “Scheduling and telemechanization
of systems of power supply”, “Reliability and electric equipment
diagnostics”.</p>
<p>The contents and technique of teaching of courses is in continuous
creative development. Example of such approach is the discipline “Power
supply of the industrial enterprises”, who reads to the prof., the
Dr.Sci.Tech. Kurenny E.G. The basic in technology of training is the
principle of problem lectures and fundamental nature.</p>
<p>A great job is done by teachers of improvement and ensuring educational
process with methodical grants of all disciplines (in printing and
electronic options). 26 grants in the Russian and Ukrainian languages
are over the last 5 years published. Among them the manual with a
signature stamp of the Ministry of Education of Ukraine “Electric
relays” (PhD. Barinberg A.D.), in which data on the main modern
electromechanical relays are for the first time stated. For increase of
learning efficiency modern technologies in the form of training systems
on PEVM, computer simulators (on computer and to mathematically focused
courses) are used. Course design (term papers and projects are carried
out on 5 disciplines) is constantly improved. The subject of degree
projects, the majority of them - real, executed on tasks of the
enterprises extends. The number of carried-out students interuniversity
and interfaculty degree projects increases.</p>
<p>Students take active part in the republican Olympic Games in the
specialty, taking prizes (1 and the 2nd place in 1997, the 2nd place in
1998, 1 and the 3rd place in 1999 and the 2nd place in 2000),
participate in republican competitions of scientific works, together
with teachers publish articles.</p>
<p>For improvement of quality of training of electrical engineers, carrying
out joint research works in Yamburg gas-field management (Russia) and
JSC “Donbasskabel” are organized chair branches.</p>
<p>Scientific work of chair is focused on the solution of the actual tasks
facing power services of the industrial enterprises, design and research
institutes. On chair by the school of sciences in the field of
statistical dynamics of systems of power supply is created prof.
Kurennyi E.G. Bases of the general theory of electrical power processes
in power supply systems are for the first time developed. Fundamental
nature of these researches and their importance is confirmed by award to
E.G. Kurennyi together with Akkad. A.K. Shidlovsky and the prof. L.V.
Tsukernik in 1986 of award NAN of Ukraine for a cycle of works
“Developing theories and methods of the analysis and optimization of
electrical power systems and power supply systems”.</p>
<p>One of the scientific directions of chair is the assessment of
reliability and safety of systems of power supply and forecasting of
accidents and accidents on technological objects during their design and
operation (hands. - Dr.Sci.Tech., prof. Kovalyov A.P.). Besides, on
chair researches on development the magnito-ferrogirodinamicheskikh of
devices of protection and automatic equipment (hands were actively
conducted. Cand.Tech.Sci., PhD. Barinberg A.D.) and to the analysis of
electromechanical transients in electric cars and networks (hands. -
Cand.Tech.Sci., PhD. Sovpel V. B.). By results of researches
ferrogidrodinamichesky indexes of current of the short circuit are
introduced at the enterprises of electric networks, allowing quickly and
safely to define the damaged site of a distributive cable network. These
devices are original by the principle of action and answer the
international standards in development of electric devices.</p>
<p>From 1987 to 1996 at chair the research “Microprocessor” laboratory
worked, researches of electric networks of 6-35 kV and development of
actions for increase of reliability of their functioning were the main
which scientific directions. Results of works of laboratory are
introduced on a number of the enterprises: PES of Kirovsky district of
Donetsk; RES “Sakhalinenergo” Yuzhnosakhalinsk; Ustyilimsky
hydroelectric power station; Avdeevsky cook-sokhimzavod; Gorlovka
Concern “Stirol”.</p>
<p>Teachers of chair published 6 monographs (E.G. Kurenny - 4,
A.D.Barinberg - 1, E.P. Ostrovsky - 1), 2 doctoral dissertations (E.G.
Kurenny, A.P. Kovalyov), 26 master's theses are defended and a number of
techniques in the form of normative documents by calculation of electric
loadings of common industrial installations (Kurenny E.G. is introduced.
Pogrebnyak N.N.); by calculation of electric loadings and tension losses
in the electric networks feeding cars of contact electric welding (Mucha
W.P.) by an assessment vzryvo-and fire safety of technological objects
(Kovalyov A.P.). Scientific development of the prof. Kurennyi E.G. are
included in GOST 13109-87 on quality of the electric power at
